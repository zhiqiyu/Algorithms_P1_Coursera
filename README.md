# Algorithms_P1_Coursera
Folder to hold materials and assignments for the Algrithms Part 1 course on Coursera.

**NOTE**:  
* To compile source files, algs4.jar need to be in the same folder.  
The correct way to compile java files from command line is: ```javac -cp "algs4:." *.java```  
The correct way to run compiled java class is ```java -cp "algs4:." xxx.class```

* From Assignment 3, Eclipse project structure is used, and the 'bin', 'lib/algs4.jar' should be added manually to properly run the code.
